A simple cross-platform C++ utility library.

Supported compilers: >=clang-4.x, >=gcc7.x; specifically, we require c++17 features such as structured bindings which aren't present in older compilers. No attempt has been made to compile under MSVC.

For the love of God, do not use the crypto routines. I am not a cryptographer or a security specialist. You have been warned.
